This repository is basically a collection of several python mini challenges that I worked on to increase my knowledge of the language.

character_input.py
This program prints out a message that states the name and year you turn 100.

This program has two options: (1) Checks if number is even or odd OR (2) Checks if num is divisible by num2

list_less_than_n.py
This program takes two inputs: a number n and a list, and then prints a list with numbers less than n

factors.py
