# python_projects
This repository is basically a collection of several python mini challenges that I worked on to increase my knowledge of the language.

1) character_input.py
   This program prints out a message that states the name and year you turn 100.

2) odd_or_even.py
   This program has two options: (1) Checks if number is even or odd OR (2) Checks if num is divisible by num2

3) list_less_than_n.py
   This program takes two inputs: a number n and a list, and then prints a list with numbers less than n

4) factors.py
   This program will print out a list with all factors of given input n
  
5) common_lists.py
    This program generates two lists, x and y, each of random lengths and generates a different list of common elements       
    between x and y
