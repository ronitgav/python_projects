"""
Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that
are overlapping. One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and
the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other
 number. And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look
 it up on Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an example, which I will
 describe below.)
